These days, people strive to achieve comfort and convenience by resorting to many methods that provide variety of services and accomplish their goals, targets and best of interest. In regards of University Of Kalamoon, it is well known that it is always in pursuit of finding the appropriate means to deliver those services to its employees and students. Hence, the idea of building a web application that provides the service of submitting annual needs request came to mind.

The user, which is the requesting party, is able to apply for a request by filling in the request form for the current year and be able to apply adjustments to this specific request until the user is satisfied with the result. After the request has been confirmed, it will be directed to the vice president of the university.

All types of requests are to be reviewed by the vice president. Who in return, will carefully examine all the requests, as in review the total requested quantity of each item and either approve on the total quantity of each item, or set a new value to be distributed relatively to each request.

The vice president is also capable of examining each request individually, and has the authority to alter on said request by forwarding it to the requesting party along with notes and observations so that the requesting party can make adjustments to adhere to the notes.

The vice president is free to perform and apply queries on the available items in the stock and the information related to these items will be returned and reviewed. For example, a query on the quantity of a certain item can be carried out.
